# Python
This repo contains useful python scripts that can prove to be very useful for general DevOPS/Automation tasks

List of scripts:
Python script to connect to MySQL database and get result for select query: db_access.py
Python script to list files in a given directory: list_files.py
Python script to read json from testdata.json file and print data from it: read_json.py
Python script to read xml from testdata.xml file and print data from it: read_xml.py
Python script to identify key frames in an avi file and save them to disk (idea is to find key frames from a video and use them to compile a gif): video_to_gif.py
